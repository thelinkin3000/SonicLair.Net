## An album-centered subsonic client for Xbox

SonicLair is a minimal, mobile-ready, album-centered music client for subsonic compatible music servers built using UWP and designed to run on Xbox.

## Features

- Connect to any subsonic-compatible music server. Tested on Navidrome.
- Album-centered music playing: if you start playing a song, the album becomes your playlist.
- Start a radio based on any song on your library.
- Search throughout your entire music library.
- Connect your Xbox to your server using SonicLair on [your phone running Android](https://github.com/thelinkin3000/SonicLair) and a QR Code. (All the communications are made within the LAN, no third-party servers involved)
- Jukebox Mode! Run an instance of Soniclair in an Xbox and control it from another instance running on Android.
